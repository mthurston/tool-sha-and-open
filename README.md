# SHA and open (4sho)

A simple dotnet tool that once installed allows users to paste a SHA and "YOLO-pen" a file within your downloads folder if it matches.  Meant primarily for executables and security purposes.

## Features
* **Cross Platform** .NET 8
* **Keeps it Simple** Always targets download folder.  No ambiguity
* **List SHAs** when ran without a SHA will output a table from your downloads folder with two columns: 1) filenames and 2) SHAs.
